# Dynamic AOT Resnet-18 Example

This example AOT-compiles a Resnet-18 module for performing inference on a dynamic number of input images.



To run this example (with Python3.11), you should clone the repository to your local device and install the requirements in a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine.git
cd SHARK-Turbine/examples/resnet-18
python -m venv rn18_venv
source ./rn18_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the requirements are installed, you should be able to run the example.

```bash
python resnet-18.py
```

The input images are pulled from the dataset at a randomized start index, so running the program multiple times will yield different results.
